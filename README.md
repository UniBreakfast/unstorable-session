## Development Methodology

- Markup is in HTML
- single page with selectable screens with forms
- lists as selects
- choice of actions as selects, button to perform
- buttons with color-coded status and tooltips
- almost no CSS (hidden, centering, font)
- UI as an object with async functions
- Data Service as an object with async functions
- app.js is bringing it all together
